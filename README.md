### Chatbot

The Care Cue Chatbot offers users two distinct modes of interaction: a symptom-based chat and an OpenAI-powered chat. Additionally, users have access to a normal chat feature for general health-related queries.

**Symptom-based Chat:** 
Users can engage in a conversation with the chatbot based on their symptoms. By providing detailed information about their health condition, the chatbot generates a comprehensive report outlining potential health issues and recommended actions.

**OpenAI Interaction:** 
Our platform integrates an OpenAI-based chat system. Users can directly interact with OpenAI to ask health-related questions.

**Normal Chat:**Â 
Additionally, users have the option to engage in a traditional chat format, where they can input general health-related queries. Our chatbot utilizes a dataset of health-related questions and responses to provide relevant information and assistance to users.
